## 🎯 Problem Statement

Engineering students face a uniquely demanding academic environment. They juggle multiple technically intensive subjects at once - each with different prerequisites, assessment styles, and cognitive demands. Traditional study planning methods fail to adapt to the dynamic, interconnected, and high-cognitive-load nature of engineering coursework.

### Key Challenges Addressed:
- **Cognitive Load Imbalance** - Different subjects demand different levels of mental effort
- **Prerequisite Dependencies** - Courses build heavily on prior concepts
- **Dynamic Prioritization Issues** - Deadlines, exams, and unexpected difficulties constantly shift priorities
- **Inefficient Study Patterns** - Cramming and last-minute studying lead to poor retention
- **Lack of Personalization** - Existing tools don't adapt to individual learning speed and preferences

---

## 💡 Solution

An AI-powered study planner tailored specifically for engineering students that:

- 📊 **Analyzes** subjects, deadlines, prerequisites, and cognitive load
- 📅 **Creates** personalized, adaptive study schedules
- ⚖️ **Balances** deep learning with timely completion
- 🔄 **Evolves** dynamically as priorities, performance, and difficulty change

## ⚡ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- Gemini API Key (get free from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey))

### Installation

1. **Clone or download the project:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shakti-ramawat/AI-StudyPlanner.git
cd AI-StudyPlanner
```

2. **Get your Gemini API Key:**
   - Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
   - Create a new API key
   - Copy your key

3. **Configure the API:**
   - Open the project in your browser
   - Click "Configure API" in the footer

## 📊 Algorithm Highlights

### Weight Calculation Formula
```
Subject Weight = (Credits × 8) + ((5 - Confidence) × 7) × CognitiveMultiplier + (WeakAreas × 3)
```

### Cognitive Load Distribution
- **High Load (Red):** New concept learning sessions
- **Medium Load (Yellow):** Practice and problem-solving
- **Low Load (Green):** Revision and buffer time

### Session Prioritization Logic
1. Subjects with low confidence get higher priority
2. High-cognitive-load topics scheduled during preferred study times
3. Prerequisite topics scheduled before dependent topics
4. Buffer time included for unexpected delays
